Project: CelOcean
Group Members: Cole Strain, Vikram Peddinti, Tyler Phung

The goal of our project was to create a 3-D, cel-shaded, ocean environment that could be explored in a boat with the user's choice of music.  The environment itself (specifically, the ocean and its waves) will respond to the music being played at the moment. 

Division of Work:

Tyler Phung: Boat / Modeling / Gameplay
Cole Strain: Cel shader / Edge Detection / Modeling
Vikram Peddinti: Ocean shader / Music / Weather

To explore the environment, use the WASD keys to navigate the boat.  To begin the music, select [n] "Play Music" and [m] "Init Music".

Our advanced features were our environment and its response to the music file being played.  This directly affects the waves.
